# The Darkroom project

## Library import

The Github repository of this project does not include the necessary libraries to execute the code so the user must download them
and move to the folder containing this file.

The necessary libraries are: AssImp, DevIL and glut. They can be found in the additional material for lab07 of the Informatica Grafica's course page.
